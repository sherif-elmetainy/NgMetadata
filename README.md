# SpaMetadata
SpaMetadata is a library that helps keep the .Net Core server model metadata in sync with the Angular 4 client-side forms. This includes the validators, property display names, property descriptions, etc.

This library is still a work in progress. When it's ready for release it will be available via nuget and npm.
